      Pokémon Go and the Pokémon Trading Card Game, as well as various
      merchandise. In media related to the franchise, Bulbasaur has been voiced

      a large plant bulb on its back. Bulbasaur is a central character in the
      Pokémon anime, being one of Ash Ketchum&apos;s main Pokémon for the first
      season, with a different one later being obtained by supporting character
      May. It is featured in various manga and is owned by protagonist Red in
      Pokémon Adventures. </p>
      <p> Bulbasaur is generally considered one of the most
      popular and widely liked Pokémon, having ranked highly in official
      popularity polls. Series producer Junichi Masuda has also specifically
      mentioned Bulbasaur as one of his favourite Pokémon. Its role in the anime
      has been suggested to have played a factor into its popularity. Conception
      and design Bulbasaur is a species of fictional creatures called Pokémon
      created for the Pokémon media franchise. Developed by Game Freak and
      published by Nintendo, the Japanese franchise began in 1996 with the video
      games Pokémon Red and Green for the Game Boy, which were later released in
      North America as Pokémon Red and Blue in 1998. In these games and their
      sequels, the player assumes the role of a Trainer whose goal is to capture
      and use the creatures&apos; special abilities to combat other Pokémon. Some
      Pokémon can transform into stronger species through a process called
      evolution via various means, such as exposure to specific items.</p>

      Each
      Pokémon have one or two elemental types, which define its advantages and
      disadvantages when battling other Pokémon. A major goal in each game is to
      complete the Pokédex, a comprehensive Pokémon encyclopedia, by capturing,
      evolving, and trading with other Trainers to obtain individuals from all
      Pokémon species. Bulbasaur first appeared as one of three Pokémon the
      player could choose as their first at the beginning of the initial Game
      Boy games, Pokémon Red and Blue, released in Japan in 1996. Its Japanese
      name, Fushigidane, is a combination of the Japanese words for mystery or
      miracle (fushigi) and seed (tane). While translating the game for
      English-speaking audiences, Nintendo gave the Pokémon &quot;cleverly
      descriptive names&quot; related to their appearance or features as a means to
      make the characters more relatable to American children, with Bulbasaur
      being named as a portmanteau relating to its dinosaurian appearance and
      the large garlic-shaped bulb on its back. Both the etymology and
      appearance of Bulbasaur, Ivysaur, and Venusaur show it getting
      increasingly more dangerous as it evolves. Bulbasaur can evolve into
      Ivysaur, which can then evolve into Venusaur. Bulbasaur was created by
      Atsuko Nishida, a character designer for Pocket Monsters Red and Blue,
      which she described as &quot;working backwards&quot; by basing it off the
      established Venusaur design. Afterwards, the design was finalized by lead
      artist Ken Sugimori who, towards the end of development, drew the
      promotional art of all the species to give them a unified look and make
      any last-minute changes. The idea to feature Bulbasaur and the other Red
      and Blue starters in a significant role in Pokémon X and Y came around a
      year and a half into the development of the games. The Mega Evolutions for
      the three Pokémon&apos;s final forms were created, and the designers decided
      that they should give players an opportunity to receive one of these
      Pokémon from Professor Sycamore, the games&apos; professor, so that players
      would be able to see and use these forms. Despite their English names,
      Sugimori confirmed that the design of Bulbasaur and its evolutions are
      based on frogs. In the Pokémon franchise, Bulbasaur are small, amphibian
      and plant Pokémon that move on all four legs. They have blue-green bodies
      with darker blue-green spots. The seed on a Bulbasaur&apos;s back is planted at
      birth and then sprouts and grows along with it. The bulb absorbs sunlight
      which allows it to grow. They can survive for days without eating because
      the bulb stores energy. In the video games, Bulbasaur has two &quot;types&quot;,
      elemental attributes that determine strengths and weaknesses: Grass and
      Poison. Series producer and director Junichi Masuda considered Bulbasaur
      the best starter Pokémon, finding it really cute and that it exemplifies
      what Pokémon is for him, citing the monster and plant combination.
      Bulbasaur has been voiced by Tara Sands and Michele Knotz in English in
      the Pokémon anime series. Appearances Bulbasaur is the first Pokémon entry
      in the Pokédex. It made its video game debut in the Japanese-language
      games Pocket Monsters Red and Green. Along with Charmander and Squirtle,
      Bulbasaur is one of the initial three Pokémon the player can choose from
      at the beginning of the games. Bulbasaur and the other starters from Red
      and Blue are replaced by Pikachu in Pokémon Yellow, and is instead
      obtainable elsewhere in the game. Bulbasaur appears in all other entries
      in the main series, though in Pokémon Sword and Shield, Bulbasaur was not
      made available until the release of Pokémon Sword and Shield: The Isle of
      Armor. Similarly, Bulbasaur was not made available in Pokémon Scarlet and
      Violet until the release of The Indigo Disk. Bulbasaur appears in various
      Pokémon spin-offs, including Pokémon Stadium and the Pokémon Mystery
      Dungeon series, where players may be assigned Bulbasaur in a personality
      quiz. Bulbasaur appears in both Pokémon Snap and New Pokémon Snap as
      Pokémon the player can take pictures of. Bulbasaur also features in
      Pokémon Go and as a playable character in Pokémon Unite. Outside of the
      Pokémon video games, Bulbasaur was also featured as a collectible in the
      Super Smash Bros. series. A costume for Mario based on it was added to
      Super Mario Maker. In the Pokémon anime, multiple Bulbasaur are owned by
      various main characters, including series protagonist Ash Ketchum. The
      character May also captures one in Pokémon: Advanced. She later makes a
      guest appearance, where it is revealed that her Bulbasaur has fully
      evolved into a Venusaur. In Pokémon Adventures, a manga based on the plot
      of the Pokémon Red and Blue games, the character Red receives a Bulbasaur
      from Professor Oak, which he nicknames Saur. Bulbasaur also appears in the
      movie Detective Pikachu, where several of them appear. In making the film,
      a bulldog was used to understand the top-heavy movement of Bulbasaur, then
      puppeteers in London were hired to create 3D puppets of it. Facial
      expressions and texture details were added using CGI. Promotion and
      reception Bulbasaur has been used heavily in promotion for the series,
      such as on the side of planes. Bulbasaur has been featured in merchandise,
      including toys and plush dolls. Bulbasaur has been depicted in action
      figures sold by Hasbro in the United States, while Tomy in Japan sold
      vinyl dolls, wind-up model kits, Singaporean popcorn with a flavor based
      on Bulbasaur, and terry cloth bean bags. It has been marketed via toys at
      fast-food chains such as McDonald&apos;s and Burger King. Bulbasaur has also
      been included in various versions of the Pokémon painting on ANA Boeing
      767s. In 2021, Seiko made limited edition luxury watches based on
      Bulbasaur and its evolutionary family. The island nation of Niue issued a
      commemorative coin with a legal tender value of one crown, which has a
      Bulbasaur on the reverse side. Bulbasaur was also among the eleven Pokémon
      chosen as Japan&apos;s mascots in the 2014 FIFA World Cup. A Bulbasaur statue
      was installed on March 25, 2018, in the municipality of Suzano, São Paulo,
      Brazil, and was the first of several other Pokémon-related statues
      installed. Bulbasaur has been largely praised by critics. Nintendo World
      Report&apos;s Pedro Hernandez highlighted its role in one episode of the anime,
      citing Bulbasaur&apos;s appealing storyline in the episode as endearing the
      species to him. He stated that this role helped him become a fan of the
      Pokémon franchise as a whole. IGN editor &quot;Pokémon of the Day Chick&quot; also
      praised Ash&apos;s &quot;attitude-packing Bulbasaur&quot; in the anime, and Official
      Nintendo Magazine&apos;s John Vekinis attributed his &quot;love of Grass-type
      Pokémon&quot; to Bulbasaur in spite of the Grass type&apos;s weaknesses. Chris
      Plante of Polygon called Bulbasaur the best Pokémon; while he felt it and
      its evolutions &quot;comparably dull&quot;, they were &quot;the most true to life&quot; as it
      looked more &quot;leathery and aged&quot; after evolving, compared to the other
      starters. Other Polygon writers highlighted Bulbasaur for similar reasons,
      mostly notably for its design, which was highlighted for providing a good
      balance of design elements while remaining cute. Another writer
      highlighted Bulbasaur&apos;s appearance in Detective Pikachu, stating that its
      cute appearance and affectionate design helped endear him to the Pokémon.
      He further noted that age seemed to affect people&apos;s perception of
      Bulbasaur; whereas younger audiences saw it as weaker, older audiences
      tended to perceive it as a more cute and appealing creature. Bulbasaur was
      ranked the third best starter Pokémon in a poll of Japanese Pokémon fans
      by ITmedia. The staff felt the popularity of Bulbasaur derived from the
      anime, particularly Ash&apos;s Bulbasaur, who at the time was the Pokémon that
      was with the series protagonist for the longest time besides Pikachu,
      spanning four-and-a-half years. They speculated this led to fans growing
      to feel attached to Bulbasaur. Bulbasaur has been noted to be less popular
      than Charmander and Squirtle. Nerdist attributed it to a lack of attention
      to the line early in the series because of Venusaur&apos;s omission from game
      box art in non-Japanese releases of the game. This led to one Twitter user
      creating an account named BulbaGanda to spread support for the Pokémon,
      which was met with considerable popularity.
